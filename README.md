# python_ireland_branding
A repo to keep assets used for branding the Python Ireland websites, PyCons and other items.



I have attached some example code to build improved Python Ireland logos.
The Python Ireland logos use the snake triskelion design.
Most of the original logos use old, small png or jpg files which don't scale well.

I have added examples in the `examples` dir for improved logos, using .svg files. These scale well for web an image design.


## Example of logo redesign:
